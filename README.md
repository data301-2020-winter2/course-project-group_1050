## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

   Our topic deals with air quality at road level in a significantly polluted area of an Italian town. Our dataset takes in hourly measurements of various metal oxides present in the air. With hourly observations we should be able to tell if there are times of day when pollution is higher, lower, high for some metals but not others. Having data from one year of observations will allow us to potentially see trends over the days of the week. A useful dashboard for this data set would show, for each metal oxide, chart with trendlines that depict their quantaties over both hours of the day, and days of the week. Also a chart for the daily average of total airbourne metal oxides over the course of the year would be an interesting graphic. Our interest in this topic comes down to our lungs. We want to know how much metal we're breathing! 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

   The Air Quality data set was provided by Saverio De Vito (saverio.devito '@' enea.it), ENEA - National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development. The data set contains 14 attributes consisting of Date, Time, True hourly averaged concentration CO in mg/m^3, PT08.S1 (tin oxide) hourly averaged sensor response, True hourly averaged overall Non-Metanic HydroCarbons concentration in microg/m^3, True hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m^3 , PT08.S2 (titania) hourly averaged sensor response, 7 True hourly averaged NOx concentration in ppb, 8 PT08.S3 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response, True hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m^3, PT08.S4 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response, PT08.S5 (indium oxide) hourly averaged sensor response, Temperature, Relative Humidity, AH Absolute Humidity. This data set was collected hourly via digital sensors over a 1 year period (March 2004 - Feb 2005) in a "highly polluted" Italian town at road level and is reserved eclusively for research purposes.
